## Welcome {#welcome}

This is the PyCologne Community website. Here we share knowledge, pin our documentation
and distribute information for external parties.

## What is PyCologne?

We are a volunteer-led local Python Community Group in Cologne and 
invite everyone to participate to make this community thrive!
We follow the [code of conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/) of the Python Software Foundation.
